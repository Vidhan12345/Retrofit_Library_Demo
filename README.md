# Retrofit_Library_Demo
Learning how to fetch data from an API using Retrofit Library. 

Here in this project I used 1 demo API
Api link : - https://quotable.io/quotes

I finally understand how to fetch data and how to check whether data is successfully fetched or Not.
For checking purpose I used Logcat using filter package:mine Result .
